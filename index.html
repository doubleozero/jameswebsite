            <p>I haven't been advertising this site to anyone, so how did you even find this site? Did you just get curious after seeing the domain my personal email uses?</p>
            <p>In any case, there isn't much to see here yet, as everything is still under construction. This main page and other pages are in testing/development stages as I learn how to develop this site. It's my own personal labor of love.</p>
            <p>There are a couple of obscure corners of the site that are operational and ready for your perusal. Click each tab for more info.</p>

            <p>My <a href="http://jameswebsite.net/thejamesblog/">blog</a> is a space for random rambling and musing, set aside from major public arenas such as Facebook.  It's running on Wordpress and will continue to be updated, hopefully with more regularity as I get my feet wet with it. Feel free to jump into the conversation there anytime.<p>
        </div>
        <div id="tabs-3">
            <p>Here reside my <a href="http://jameswebsite.net/forums">forums</a>, which are operational, but purely in testing mode right now.  It's your run-of-the-mill phpBB board that I'll breath more life into once I'm confident it's stable and worth anyone's attention.  Feel free to play around in there.</p>

            <p>Join us in World of Warcraft!  I run my own progression raiding guild and we're always looking for new friends.</p>
